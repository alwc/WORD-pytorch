# WORD: Webtoon Object Recognition and Detection

`Note : It's not the final version code. I will the refine and update the code over and over again.`
### Sample Results

### Overview

WORD detect objects(speech bubbles, cuts, and line texts) in webtoon or cartoon. You can also meet ocr(line text detection + recognition) results and English translation with papago API if you want. 
I have referenced and used [CRAFT-pytorch](https://github.com/clovaai/CRAFT-pytorch) to detect line text, [Faster-RCNN-pytorch](https://github.com/jwyang/faster-rcnn.pytorch/tree/pytorch-1.0) to detect speech bubble.
And I have implemented all the code to find elaborately contours of speech bubble, detect cut with image processing(OpenCV) and recognize korean text with res-18 network.    
You can check README.md for each project folder if you want more details.

## Demo
`Note: When you test own your test cartoon images including several objects, You can get the segmentation results of speech bubble, cut, line texts.`

- Run **`python demo.py`**
