# TOON Text Detection based on CRAFT(Character-Region Awareness For Text detection)

`Note : This is TOON Text(character) Detection, ESPECIALLY texts difficult to detect like text of EFFECT SOUNDS in toon. I implemented training code for CRAFT. And I am planning to train CRAFT with my own datasets to find difficult TEXT. It's not the final version code. I will the refine and update the code over and over again.`

## Install Requirements:                                                                                                        
1、Pytorch>=0.4.1                                                                                                                             
2、torchvision>=0.2.1 			                                                    																			                             
3、opencv-python>=3.4.2    
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```                                                                                                                                                                                
## Training 
`Note: When you train own your datasets, You must have character Anotations like SynthText. In other words, this code doesn't          contain weakly supervision part. We don't need this part because webtoon image is synthetic(possible to get character datasets by generating characters like synthText. But, character dataset can't release because of company policy.`                                         
- Run **`python kick_off.py --train 1`**

## Test
`Note: When you test own your test images, You can get the characters on images for text recognition`

- Run **`python kick_off.py --test 1`**

## Evaluation
`Note: Evalution is under the developing. so, It can not run the code now. I am planning to use IOU Method and update as soon as possible.`

- Run **`python kick_off.py --evaluation 1`**
